# Integrate autofill feature with Github Actions

### Prerequisite
Before following this tutorial, please make sure to have an active Github account.

### Steps
There are four main steps to configure the bot to access your local repository and logbook account;
1. Fork the project to your Github account
2. Make a Github token to access the repository. This is used to make a local daily log of your logbook. 
3. Make repository secrets. These values are used to access your repository and logbook page.
4. Add Github Actions

#### Fork the project

1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/bernardadhitya/intern-logbook-chatbot) to your Github account

6. You will get your Github token. **COPY IT IMMEDIATELY**, once you refresh/reload the page, you will not see the code again

#### Make repository secrets

7. Go back to **your forked repository settings**. On the left, you will find a sidebar. Click on "Secrets"

8. Here, you will need to create new secrets.

These values are used to access the repository and your logbook page

| Name | Value |
| ---- | ----- |
| `MY_GITHUB_TOKEN` | Paste your github token you previously made |
| `MY_USERNAME` | Your BINUS ID (NIM) |
| `MY_PASSWORD` | Your account password |
> Secrets are encrypted and is only accessable by the repository in your own account, so it won't be visible to anyone.

#### Add Github Actions

9. Open [this link](https://github.com/bernardadhitya/intern-logbook-chatbot/blob/master/docs/autofill-github-actions-assets/template.yml) on new tab, then copy the whole script

10. Go to the Actions tab, and set a new workflow

11. Choose "set up workflow yourself"

12. Delete the boilerplate and paste the whole script there, and name it `autofill.yml`

13. On line 40, there will be a step to commit data to your forked repository. Replace `INSERT_YOUR_GITHUB_EMAIL_HERE` and `INSERT_YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE` with your credentials.

That's it! Github Actions will use that value to access the repository and your logbook account to automatically fill your logbook.
